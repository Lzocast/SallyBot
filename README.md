Hello, and thank you for taking the time to learn about Sally.

This is a first time programmer's attempt to merge various learning projects into a comprehensive and interactive 'chatbot'. 
Feedback on coding strategy, optimization, and improvements for interactivity are both welcome and appreciated.

To get started please download the main SallyV3.py file and the following into the same directory: Weather.py, game2.py, and saytime.py.

You will also need to have the request module for python installed: $python -m pip install requests

NOTE: depending on your system you may need to specify python3 instead of python for the above command to work. This code was written entirely in Python 3,
so older versions may not work as intended.

Above all else, have fun with this.
